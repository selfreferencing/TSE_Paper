## Overview

This repository contains formal proofs for the Theory of Strategic Evolution (TSE), which analyzes strategic replicators: AI systems that optimize utility functions and control their own replication.

The formalization covers:
- RUPSI axiom system
- Games with Endogenous Players (GEPs)
- Replicator dynamics and Lyapunov stability
- ESDI characterization (existence, sparsity, equivalence)
- Small-gain condition for multi-level systems
- G∞ closure theorem
- Alignment impossibility
- Hopf bifurcation at stability threshold

## Key Theorems

### ESDI Existence and Sparsity
```lean
theorem esdi_exists (sys : RUPSISystem) : ∃ x : ESDI sys, True

theorem esdi_sparsity (x : ESDI sys) (h : binding_constraints sys x = m) :
  (support x).card ≤ m
```

### Small-Gain Stability
```lean
theorem small_gain_stability (Γ : Matrix n n ℝ) (hΓ : spectral_radius Γ < 1) :
  ∃ V : Lyapunov, joint_lyapunov V
```

### Alignment Impossibility
```lean
theorem alignment_impossible (sys : ModifiableSystem) 
  (h : full_reachability sys) :
  ∀ B : StabilityBasin, ∃ path : ModificationSequence, escapes path B
```

### G∞ Closure
```lean
theorem admissible_closed (φ ψ : Modification) 
  (hφ : φ ∈ M₀) (hψ : ψ ∈ M₀) : 
  (ψ ∘ φ) ∈ M₀
```

## Building

Requires Lean 4 and Mathlib4.

```bash
lake build
```

---

## Axioms Used

Some proofs rely on standard mathematical axioms not yet in Mathlib:
- Spectral theory for general matrices
- ODE existence and uniqueness (Picard-Lindelöf)
- Hopf bifurcation theorem

These are marked with `sorry` or `axiom` declarations.
